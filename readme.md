# Noodle Jump
## A doodle jump remake

This is a project that I did to help learn aspects of developing a full game from start to finish. It is built with unity in c# with design patterns and algorithms used to improve fluidity of the game. This project was a learning experience of singleton  and pub sub usage.

This game hosts a live leaderboard with Unity PlayFab as the backend to keep trach of live high scores. Users can anonymously sign in to keep track of their progress.
